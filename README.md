# Epicodus Track Finder

#### _A simple survey to find out which track at Epicodus to take_

#### By _**Jessie Waite**_

## Description

 _This is a simple survey to help prospective Epicodus students determine which track is best for them. This website collects input from the user in the form of radio button selections, and using JavaScript and JQuery, determines the best track using a simple formula that adds the values of each answer. The end output is a suggested track (e.g., CSS/Design vs.. Ruby/Rails vs., C#/.NET.). There are five questions (excluding one form that asks the user what their name is) that the user may answer and five possible track outcomes._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the "track" repository to your desktop from GitHub here: https://github.com/jbellwaite/track.git_
* _Open the "track" folder_
* _Open a web-browser, preferably Chrome._
* _Drag "index.html" into an open tab in your web browser to open the application._
* _Once open in the web browser, answer all questions and press "submit". The application should then hide the questionnaire and  display the answer with a picture of the particular track's logo._

 _Use a text editor like Atom to edit code._

_Alternatively, you can use the following link to directly open the application in your web browser: jbellwaite.github.io/track_

## Known Bugs

_I don't know of any major bugs or work-arounds that I had to take on this project. I did, however, change the order of the radio button groups a lot after I had already written the functions. That means the order the input name appears within the function does not match the order the function appears within my html. I also did not change the order of the images at the very bottom of my html to match the order they appear within the branching logic within my scripts.js file. This makes it messy, and I would prefer if they all matched order, for easier editing._
